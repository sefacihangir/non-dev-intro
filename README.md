# Development Introduction
This is a simple demo web application intended to serve as an introduction to development for non-developers.

This project should be used together with a presentation inside a workshop-like meeting. It should be held by a developer who should write the code during the workshop.

The main goals for such a presentation are:

 - To clear out some misconceptions related to development.
 - To provide insight related to the though process and tools used during development.
 - To understand some high level concepts related to programming.
 
 This presentation is not intended to serve as an introduction to programming for future developers.

You can find the proposed presentation on [GitHub Pages](https://serban-petrescu.github.io/non-dev-intro/) (check out the `gh-pages` branch; thanks go to hakimel for his excellent [Reveal-Js Framework](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)). 
 
Apart from the code of this repository, some very small [JavaDoc](https://serban-petrescu.github.io/non-dev-intro/javadoc/) and [JsDoc](https://serban-petrescu.github.io/non-dev-intro/jsdoc/msg.demo.Employee.html) are produced as part of the workshop.

A mocked version (without the Java backend) of the user interface is available [here on GitHub Pages](https://serban-petrescu.github.io/non-dev-intro/mocked).
