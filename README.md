# Development Introduction
This is a simple demo web application intended to serve as an introduction to development for non-developers.

This project should be used together with a presentation inside a workshop-like meeting. It should be held by a developer who should write the code during the workshop.

The main goals for such a presentation are:

 - To clear out some misconceptions related to development.
 - To provide insight related to the though process and tools used during development.
 - To understand some high level concepts related to programming.
 
 This presentation is not intended to serve as an introduction to programming for future developers.
